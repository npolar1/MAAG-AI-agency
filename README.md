> **A strategic framework for building your AI content agency. Currently in active development.**

## The Vision: From Chaos to Strategy

Most people use heard that AI could help for content creation and try firing off random prompts. The results are inconsistent and off-brand.

**MAAG** proposes a better way: **orchestrating a crew of specialized AI agents.** Think of it as hiring your own content agency where each employee is an AI expert in a specific field. You are the creative director.

This repository is the blueprint for that system.

## The Plan: The Creaw Team

The core of the MAAG framework is a structured team. (This is our strategic hypothesis, open for discussion).

| Proposed Role | Responsibility | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Strategist** | Analyzes trends, plans content pillars. | `PLANNED` |
| **The Creative Director** | Brainstorms viral ideas and concepts. | `PLANNED` |
| **The Scriptwriter** | Crafts video scripts, captions, and CTAs. | `PLANNED` |
| **The Visual Designer** | Generates imagery and visual concepts. | `PLANNED` |
| **The Editor** | Polishes output for a human, consistent tone. | `PLANNED` |

## What's Here? (Right Now)

This project is just starting. This repository currently serves as:
*   **The Project Manifesto:** Defining the vision and the problem we're solving.
*   **A Discussion Hub:** A place to gather ideas and feedback on the framework.
*   **A Living Roadmap:** The Issues and Projects tabs will track our progress.

## How You Can Contribute (This is needed!)

We are building this in the open and **need your help.** You don't need to be a developer.

1.  **Discuss Ideas:** Go to the [**Issues**](https://github.com/your-username/MAAG-AI-Agency/issues) tab. Are the proposed AI roles correct? What are we missing?
2.  **Share Prompts:** Have a killer prompt for a "Scriptwriter" agent? Share it in an Issue!
3.  **Define Workflows:** How should an "Idea" move from the Strategist to the Scriptwriter? Let's design the process together.
4.  **Spread the Word:** Star this repo if you believe in the vision.

## For Future Clients

The goal of this framework is to power a modern, efficient, and high-quality content creation service for businesses. This is our open-source playbook.
